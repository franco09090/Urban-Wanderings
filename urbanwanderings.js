history:["Photos/London/HistoryLondon.jpg","London is the capital city of the United Kingdom. It is the U.K.’s largest metropolis and its economic, transportation, and cultural centre. London is also among the oldest of the world’s great cities, with its history spanning nearly two millennia. London is the capital city of the United Kingdom. It is the U.K.’s largest metropolis and its economic, transportation, and cultural centre. London is also among the oldest of the world’s great cities, with its history spanning nearly two millennia. London’s founding can be traced to 43 CE, when the Roman armies began their occupation of Britain under Emperor Claudius. At a point just north of the marshy valley of the River Thames, where two low hills were sited, they established a settlement they called Londinium. The first definite mention of London occurs in 60 CE by the Roman historian Tacitus. (after Christ). It is among the oldest of the world’s great cities—its history spanning nearly two millennia—and one of the most cosmopolitan. By far Britain’s largest metropolis, it is also the country’s economic, transportation, and cultural center. It is situated in southeastern England, lying astride the River Thames some 50 miles (80 km) upstream from its estuary on the North Sea.","It is physically a polycentric city, with many core districts and no clear hierarchy among them. Historically, London grew from three distinct centers: the walled settlement founded by the Romans on the banks of the Thames in the 1st century CE, today known as the City of London, “the Square Mile,” or simply “the City”; facing it across the bridge on the lower gravels of the south bank, the suburb of Southwark; and a mile upstream, on a great southward bend of the river, the City of Westminster. The three settlements had distinct and complementary roles. London, “the City,” developed as a center of trade, commerce, and banking. The population of London already exceeded one million by 1800. A century later it reached 6.5 million. The city’s physical expansion was not constrained either by military defenses (a highly influential factor on continental Europe) or by the intervention of state power (so evident in the town planning of Paris, Vienna, Rome, and other capitals of continental Europe). Although much of the land around London was owned by the aristocracy, the church, and other institutions with feudal roots, its development was the work of unfettered capitalism driven by the housing demands of the rising middle class. Tourist traffic concentrates on an area defined by the main attractions, each drawing between one and seven million visitors in the course of the year: Buckingham Palace, the British Museum, the National Gallery, Westminster Abbey, Madame Tussaud’s waxwork collection, the Tower of London, the three great South Kensington museums (Natural History, Science, and Victoria and Albert), and the Tate galleries. In scale, the London most tourists visit resembles the metropolis as it was in the late 18th century, a city of perhaps 10 square miles (26 square km) explorable on foot in all directions from Trafalgar Square.","Photos/London/History London 2.jpg"],
tips:["I ate a sandwich from a kiosk nearby (it was too spicy). In order to save time, I recommend you not to spend too much time eating. Just eat something fast. At night you can have a more prepared meal. That worked out for me.","Use the Underground system to move. It works really well and you can pay by Credit Card. It isn't that cheap but it is the best transportation method. It has lots of stations all around the city of London and its surroundings. You can take the train to the airport. But I bought a ticket previously. Remember to do things in advance with time.",],
titlesDays:["Day 1","Day 2","Day 3"],
experienceDay1:["In my own experience, I spent 3 days in London but with 4 it would be better. The following texts and itineraries are based on my own experience which was great. The first day (I arrived late at night the past day) I got up early to go to the Sky Garden building. This is a wonderful and modern building which is accessible for free but you must get a ticket before going because a lot of people go. If you go without one, you will probably wait a long time before having the chance to enter. I used to take the subway from Paddington (where my hotel room was) to Monument station (check photo subway). At the roof of it, which has a cafe and an inner garden (that’s why it is called Sky Garden), you can have amazing 360° views of all London. I was unlucky and the weather was bad that day and I could not see that good.","After that, I headed to the Tower of London which is a great attraction if you are with kids. On the way, I passed along some beautiful roads with antique buildings. The Tower of London is an iconic historic castle located on the north bank of the River Thames in central London, England. It has a rich and varied history, serving as a royal palace, a prison, a treasury, an armoury, and even a zoo at one point. It is literally the castle of London which is along the London Bridge and the Thamesis River. In this place, the king used to collect money from the ships that wanted to go along the river. It was declared a UNESCO site in 1998. Unfortunately, you have to pay a ticket to enter this place. An adult ticket costs around 30 pounds and then the price goes down according to the age of the visitor.","Right outside the Tower of London, you can cross to the other side of the river by the Tower Bridge, an icon of Britain and a very famous place. You can go to the top but I do not recommend it. It is not worth the money. By crossing to the other side, you can take a walk around the riverside where you can find some nice malls and modern structures. On the way, you will go past London Bridge. After some walking (which this trip will involve a lot so be prepared), you will find the Borough Market where you can have some food and taste exotic meals.","After that, I crossed again the Thamesis through the Southwark bridge and went to visit St. Paul’s Cathedral. This cathedral is one of London's most iconic landmarks, renowned for its majestic dome and rich architectural history. The entrance is not free and I did not spend time inside of it.","Then I headed to the British Museum, one of the most complete ones in the world. The entrance is free and you can find artefacts and sculptures from Ancient Egypt to whatever time you imagine and want to see. There is a lot to see but if you spend too much time there you will probably get bored. Though I spent more time because our airplane company (Iberia fuck you) had lost our luggage yesterday and we were trying to solve it.","Then we went to eat in Carnaby Street which has some nice restaurants. Be aware of prices, I had a limited budget but spent around 20 pounds / euros per person depending on the place. That was day 1. It involved a lot of walking but if you are not keen into that, you can use the London subway which is great and functions really well."],
experienceDay2:["I woke up early again (I recommend this to make the most out of your holidays) and then took the underground from Paddington to St. James’s Park station. I walked around Buckingham Palace, the palace of the king of England, and watched the Guard’s swap. Then I went for a tour guide inside the palace which unfortunately is not free. The adult entrance is 32 pounds but for kids the price is lower. (https://www.rct.uk/visit/buckingham-palace). I was not allowed to take pictures inside of it but I got some after I left it, in the park of the palace. It was interesting to learn about the history of the place but I think you could go doing something else instead of the tour guide and you wouldn't regret it.","After that, I walked all the way to Westminster Abbey, a historic church located in the heart of London. It's one of the most famous religious buildings in the United Kingdom and has been the traditional location for coronations and burials of British monarchs for centuries. The Abbey's history dates back over a thousand years, with construction starting in the 10th century. It is now a very visited tourist attraction due to its great architecture. Like Buckingham Palace, the entry is not free and the tickets are around 30 pounds per adult. (https://www.westminster-abbey.org/visit-us/prices-entry-times). If you like to learn about the history of kings in England, this is the place for you. It was really nice inside as you can see in the pictures but after a while it may seem tedious to listen to every king’s history through the electronic device they give you for the tour. Despite this, I enjoyed the visit. I leave it up to you if you choose to go inside or go to another place.","After going inside Westminster Abbey, I walked towards the Thames river and looked at the Big Ben right in front of my eyes. This iconic clock of London was completed in 1859. It is renowned for its accuracy and impressive chimes. The bell itself weighs over 13 tons and strikes every hour, producing the distinctive deep tone that has become synonymous with London. It is a good place to take pictures. Be aware lots of other tourists are doing the same thing so be patient. If you cross the river you can also see the London Eye which is also pretty famous but I think it is a waste of time to go up it. It would be a long time before you can ride it which you can use for something more interesting. In this place you can take pictures with the Palace of Westminster and the Big Ben in the background.","Later, I walked towards Trafalgar Square which is famous for being the protests’ square. Here people mobilise and express themselves about whatever they want to the government. This place is named before Britain’s victory over France in the Napoleonic wars in the 1800s. In the middle we can find Nelson’s column which commemorates the victory driven by vice-admiral Horatio Nelson in the British navy. Then I went to Chinatown and then to the East to Covent Garden. Both are interesting places to visit. In Covent Garden you can find the Royal Opera House which you can go inside and to its balcony to take some pictures. Also, there are lots of shops and stores nearby. Take a look because you may find an offer in a shop you like. Be free to explore the surrounding area of the centre of Covent Garden. I ate something at Starbucks and then returned to my hotel room in Paddington through Piccadilly Circus Underground Station. When I returned I found my luggage waiting for me and that was a relief for all the family."],
experienceDay3:["I got up and got ready for my last day in London. I really liked it and wanted to stay at least one more day. There were plenty of things to do but my time was limited. I walked towards the West, where I had not gone before. I went through Kensington Gardens. It is a Royal Garden which is really beautiful and well maintained. There you can find Kensington Palace, which was the residence of Princess Diana and of many other royal family members. I walked around it enjoying the sun, plants and beauty.","Then I walked to the Royal Albert Hall which is an amazing building of orange bricks. Then I continued my way looking at nice cars and buildings and entered the Science Museum. The entrance is free but it is best to have a reservation to enter. There you can find information about many topics ranging from space to cell phones and computers. It is an interesting and interactive place which is great to go with curiosity and kids will be amazed.","I spent some time there and then I went to Harrods which is a luxurious shopping mall. I obviously did not have money to buy anything from there, I just went to check the things shown. I continued walking to Hyde park and spent a lot of time there, relaxing and watching the nature of one of London’s biggest royal parks. There, just like in Trafalgar Square, a bunch of people were also doing debates on various topics. Then I went walking through Oxford and Regent streets that have amazing shops and cars. I bought some clothes there. Then I entered the Royal Academy to go to the bathroom (It was an emergency, fortunately I found a restroom).","After that, I took the underground from the nearest station that went through Camden town. It had a nice market with a lot of variety and a canal that went through the neighbourhood. I went along the canal and saw many boats that were transformed into floating houses. I really enjoyed it and recommend exploring that area a little bit. Although it is nice, there are lots of tourists and be aware of the time you go there. I do not recommend going there too late. Finally, I went to Notting Hill and saw the colourful houses of this neighbourhood in which the famous movie was filmed. I took a picture in the blue door of the movie. Then I returned home and got ready to the next city I was visiting: Amsterdam in the Netherlands."],

  "title": "Amsterdam Travel Guide",
  "history": [
      "Amsterdam originated as a small fishing village in the 13th century CE. To protect themselves from floods, the early inhabitants had to build dikes on both sides of the river, and about 1270 they built a dam between these dikes. Even then, merchant ships from Amsterdam sailed as far as the Baltic Sea and laid the foundation of the future trade centre, acting as a link between northern Europe and Flanders (now northern Belgium and northern France). The city was under the jurisdiction of the counts of Holland, one of whom, Count Floris V, granted the homines manentes apud Amestelledamme ('people living near the Amstel dam') a toll privilege in 1275. This document mentions the name Amsterdam for the first time, though a full charter was not granted until 1306. The city rapidly extended its business, and in 1489, as a sign of gratitude for the support given by the city to the Burgundian-Austrian monarchs, Emperor Maximilian I allowed Amsterdam to adorn its armorial bearings with the imperial crown. By then Holland’s greatest commercial town and port, as well as the granary of the northern Netherlands, Amsterdam had become a centre of wealth and influence in Europe.",
      "After the Netherlands passed to the Spanish crown in the 16th century, a religious and political rebellion against Spanish oppression spread across the region. Amsterdam hesitated to join the rebellion led by William I (the Silent), prince of Orange, but in 1578 there was a bloodless revolution in the city. The magistrates, together with the majority of Roman Catholic priests, were deported; the religious orders and communities were secularized; the Dutch Reformed church effectively replaced the Roman Catholic church; and Amsterdam joined the Dutch rebellion against Spain. Amsterdam was still a small city with no more than about 30,000 inhabitants, but things changed quickly, especially in 1585, when Spanish troops recaptured Antwerp (in modern Belgium), then the dominant port and commercial centre of the Netherlands. Dutch forces responded by blockading the Schelde River, Antwerp’s only access to the sea. The fall of Antwerp led to a wholesale influx of mainly Protestant refugees into the towns of the northern Netherlands, especially Amsterdam. Their arrival enriched the city’s intellectual, cultural, and commercial life. Banking and shipbuilding especially flourished. Much of the trade formerly concentrated in Antwerp then moved to Amsterdam, and along with the Flemish merchants soon came hundreds of Jews expelled from Portugal, followed by their coreligionists from the area of modern Germany and eastern Europe. The city soon became a trading metropolis, whose population more than tripled between 1565 and 1618. Merchant ships from Amsterdam not only sailed to the Baltic and the Mediterranean but also plied the long sea route to the East Indies and established colonies in South America and southern Africa.",
      "The international trade on which Amsterdam had thrived suffered greatly during the Napoleonic period (Britain’s embargo on France), and it was only the revival of Dutch rule and commerce in the East Indies in the 1830s that began to restore prosperity to the city. After 1850 sustained growth set in, and the population doubled (to 500,000) by 1900. The North Sea Canal, built during the 1870s, strengthened the port by providing a direct link to the North Sea. Amsterdam suffered from the disruption of trade during World War I, but modest prosperity resumed in the 1920s. The Great Depression and World War II were especially traumatic for the capital. The German army occupied the Netherlands in 1940, and Allied bombers attacked industrial areas several times. However, the city’s severest loss was the deportation of its 70,000 Jewish inhabitants. There were heroic exploits in Amsterdam by the Dutch Resistance and many quiet deeds of valour in protecting those persecuted by the Nazi regime, such as the family of Anne Frank. However, the city’s Jews and their old quarter were almost entirely eliminated. During the 1960s and ’70s, numerous radical movements arose, some of them highly political and tightly structured, but many of them playful and satirical, based on street theatre. Public demonstrations often turned into confrontations with the increasingly bewildered and beleaguered police. Riots took place at the wedding of Princess (later Queen) Beatrix in 1966 and at her coronation parade in 1980, and demonstrations, confrontations, and riots over a variety of political issues occurred in central Amsterdam repeatedly into the 1980s. During the 1990s the intensity of street protest diminished, but there is still a radicalism in Amsterdam’s public life that is hard to find anywhere else."

      "I took a plane from Heathrow Airport in London to Amsterdam’s Schiphol airport. Then I took the train from Schiphol to Amsterdam Central and then to my hotel on the other side of the canal.",
      "My day started with a walk around the center of the city which you can check on Google Maps. Then I spent the rest of the afternoon with a guided boat tour throughout the canals of the center of Amsterdam. It showed the history of Amsterdam and its main buildings. You will be surprised by the quantity of bikes. There are practically no cars. You can use the tram as public transport to move around. However, you must get your tickets at the train terminal. There are various options according to the number of days you are staying and will need to move around. It is easier to pay by card but in some places, you may be able to pay with cash. The cruise around the city costs around 15 euros per person. It is an experience worth doing. Apart from learning (the guide is available in a lot of languages) you will be able to make a quick scan of the city and its canals. I strongly recommend it.",
      "Then I continued with a walk around the east side of the city center which has 3 nice streets along the canals to walk around. To go to this zone you must continue from the Amsterdam Central station to the main street (Damrak) and then go to your left. Take as a reference the church Oude Kerk. From there explore two or three streets to the east. Feel free to explore around the city while you have daylight. While you move you will see numerous canals and places to eat. The zone you will be visiting is the Red Zone of Amsterdam in which you will find brothels (which are legal). Most of them are in the north part of it. Don't take pictures of them or you will have to pay a fine. However, those places aren't too eye-catching unless you are looking for them. You won't see them if you don't search for them. Then I ate in a restaurant which was delicious and cheap in Damrak street. After that I returned to the hotel using the ferry."

      "This day was almost the whole day dedicated to a guided tour from Civitatis which cost around 50 euros.",
      "The tour I did involved visiting windmills, typical 15th-century houses, traditional cheese factories... On this tour, we visited the most rural Holland: Zaanse Schans, Edam, Volendam, and Marken. In my opinion, this was an amazing experience which I really enjoyed and I recommend everyone to do it. It shows you the history and culture of this country with a guide who is really well informed (at least in my case) and speaks Spanish. He was named Tirzo. He was really funny and made explanations interesting and not boring.",
      "My day started with the preparation of this tour and then going to the meeting point to start our voyage. We first visited Edam, a beautiful town with really nice architecture. Its houses seemed to be taken out from a dream. After a little visit around the city, we visited a cheese factory which explained how they made it (I could not understand too much because the explanation was in little English) and then we could taste many of the cheeses they sell. It was the best cheese I ate in my whole life.",
      "Then we continued to the next city of the tour which was Volendam. Fun fact: most cities in the Netherlands end with 'dam' which means exactly that, a dam. The Netherlands is like a swamp and they use it to build these dams to control water and gain terrain. While travelling from one place to another you can see how the countryside has plenty of these dams and canals. This city is a coastal one which has a beautiful port and architecture. We walked along the centre and its port and there was the opportunity to taste some fish and chips fished right that morning.",
      "After that, we then passed along Marken which is a little town on a peninsula. This peninsula is an artificial one built using dams. This dam surrounds a lake which is being refilled to gain terrain for construction, it used to be a sea time ago. We spent little time in Marken as it is a little town. We visited a traditional wooden house and a workshop where a man was working on wooden shoes. I then returned to Amsterdam after a long day. The tour ended in the Amsterdam Central station.",
      "This tour was good value for money. They picked us up and returned us to the Amsterdam Central station. The guide was very informative and the itinerary was well-planned. Highly recommended if you want to see a bit of rural Holland!"

      "This day also involved a guided visit which in this case was to Brussels in Belgium. This tour was also provided by Civitatis which is around 70 euros per person. It was a 3 hour trip by bus from Amsterdam to Brujas. Although you are entering a different country, you do not need to migrate again because it is part of the European Union. Once we got there at 12 pm, we got down the bus and started our journey. We walked all around the centre of the city which is only available to pedestrians. You are able to ride a float with horses exactly like they did 2 centuries ago. The history of Brujas, or Bruges, is rich and diverse. Founded in the 9th century by Vikings, Bruges developed around fortifications established by Count Baldwin I of Flanders. By the 12th century, it had become one of Northern Europe’s most important trade centres, known for its markets and trade in wool, cloth, and lace.",
      "During its Golden Age from the 13th to the 15th century, Bruges was a cultural and economic hub, with impressive architecture and artists like Jan van Eyck contributing to its cultural richness. However, in the 16th century, the silting of the Zwin channel and political turmoil led to a decline in trade and population, causing economic stagnation. In the 19th century, Bruges experienced a revival due to tourism and interest in its mediaeval past, earning it the nickname “Venice of the North.” Designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000, Bruges balances its historical heritage with modern amenities.",
      "Today, Bruges is known for its mediaeval architecture, cobbled streets, and canals, attracting millions of visitors annually. While tourism is a major economic driver, the city also has a diverse economy including education, services, and light industry. Bruges' history is a testament to its resilience and ability to preserve its unique heritage while adapting to modern times.",
      "This city seems like one lost in time which gives you the impression that you are in the Middle ages. I walked all around the nicest part of it and its central square and went for a boat tour around the canals of the city. It is amazing to see how mediaeval architecture and canals have stayed the same for centuries. Do not forget to take a picture with the Rosary Quay which is a beautiful attraction of this place. After some hours in the city I returned back to Amsterdam to prepare for the last day. It's well worth visiting as a day trip from Amsterdam to experience its medieval charm and cultural attractions."

      "I spent my last day by visiting the outskirts of the historical centre of Amsterdam. I used the tram to move along the city and walked a lot. I walked along its canals and parks. First I took the tram to the Grachtengordel neighbourhood which is characterised by its fairs with things of all types. We spent a while looking for some clothes. Feel free to explore.",
      "After that, I took a tram to Leidseplein and ate at Burger King so as to eat fast and continue discovering the city. Then I took a walk around Vondelpark which is a really big one that I had to only cover half of it because we have got tickets for the Van Gogh museum which is 22 euros for people above 18 and free for those under that age. However, I recommend you have a reservation for those tickets because it is a very visited place and you might not enter without one.",
      "Here I learnt about Van Gogh’s life, one the Netherlands most famous artists and of all history. I could take a look and take pictures of all his beautiful works. Although I do not like art that much, its history and beautifulness makes you appreciate art more and have a different insight of it. Then I had a walk around the incredible city centre for a last time before leaving this fantastic place.",
      "Overall, Amsterdam offers a wealth of cultural and historical attractions, from world-class museums to scenic canal views, making it a memorable destination for travelers."

  "history": [
      "Rome, the capital of Italy, has been a major human settlement for almost three millennia. It is the fourth most populous city in the European Union, by population within the city limits, and the most populous Italian city. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of the Tiber. The Vatican City is an independent country inside the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city; for this reason, Rome has sometimes been described as the capital of two states. Rome has also been the capital of the Roman Kingdom, a Roman Republic and an Empire. It is the city of the Roman Empire, one of the world's most successful empires, known for its architectural legacy. Rome has also been a major religious and cultural center since the Middle Ages, serving as the spiritual home of the Catholic Church and the location of the Vatican City, an independent city-state enclaved within Rome.",
      "Rome's history spans over 2,800 years, during which time it has been a hub of civilization and power. It began as a small agricultural community around the 8th century BCE on the banks of the Tiber River, and later grew into a major city-state and center of the Roman Republic (509-27 BCE). Rome became the capital of the Roman Empire in 27 BCE under Emperor Augustus and flourished as the epicenter of one of the largest empires in history, encompassing much of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East.",
      "The city's influence in politics, culture, religion, and architecture continued through the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. Rome was the seat of the Papacy and the spiritual center of Western Christianity, drawing pilgrims from all over Europe. The Renaissance period saw a revival of classical learning and arts in Rome, with artists and architects like Michelangelo, Raphael, and Bernini contributing to the city's grandeur.",
      "Modern Rome is a bustling metropolis that seamlessly blends its ancient past with contemporary life. Visitors to Rome can explore iconic landmarks such as the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, and the Pantheon, which offer glimpses into the city's ancient glory. The Vatican Museums house priceless treasures, including Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling, while St. Peter's Basilica is a masterpiece of Renaissance architecture and a symbol of Catholicism's cultural influence.",
      "Beyond its historical and religious significance, Rome is renowned for its culinary delights, fashion scene, and vibrant street life. Visitors can savor traditional Roman cuisine, shop in chic boutiques along Via Condotti, or simply wander through charming piazzas and narrow cobblestone streets.",
      "Rome's climate is Mediterranean, characterized by hot summers and mild, rainy winters. The best times to visit are spring (April to June) and fall (September to October), when the weather is pleasant and tourist crowds are manageable.",
      "Whether you're fascinated by ancient history, religious art, or contemporary culture, Rome offers a rich tapestry of experiences that captivate visitors from around the globe."

      "I got to Rome by train and descended at Roma Termini. Then I got into the A subway line and got to Spagna station in Piazza Spagna, very near to the hotel I was staying at. I started by going to the Fontana di Trevi, a very famous place which is highly visited all year round. Designed by Nicola Salvi and completed by Giuseppe Pannini in 1762, it stands as one of the most iconic and largest fountains in the city, reaching 26.3 metres high and 49.15 metres wide. The fountain features a majestic central figure of Neptune, the god of the sea, flanked by allegorical statues and set against a grand palatial backdrop. It is famous for the tradition of tossing a coin into its waters to ensure a return to Rome. It is an excellent place to take pictures but unfortunately you have to be patient because there are lots of people. Once you get there, there is a United Colors of Benetton shop at your back and from there you can take a good picture on the first floor. ",
      "Then I went to the Rome Pantheon and I had to wait in the queue. This building is the Roman one best preserved in the world. The Pantheon, originally built by Marcus Agrippa in 27 BC and later rebuilt by Emperor Hadrian around 126 AD, is one of Rome's most remarkable and well-preserved ancient buildings. This architectural marvel is known for its massive domed roof, featuring an oculus that opens to the sky, and its vast, harmonious interior. The Pantheon's portico, with its imposing Corinthian columns, leads to a rotunda with a coffered concrete dome, which remains the world's largest unreinforced concrete dome. Originally a temple dedicated to all Roman gods, it has served as a Christian church since the 7th century. The Pantheon's enduring structural ingenuity and its seamless blend of ancient Roman and Renaissance influences make it a timeless symbol of architectural excellence.",
      "After that, I went to Piazza Navona and looked around at the beautiful buildings and architecture. Piazza Navona, one of Rome's most famous and vibrant squares, is celebrated for its stunning Baroque architecture and lively atmosphere. Built on the site of the ancient Stadium of Domitian, it retains the elongated shape of the original Roman circus. The piazza is also home to the Church of Sant'Agnese in Agone, designed by Francesco Borromini, which adds to its architectural splendour. After that I returned to the hotel because it was almost night and had a meal at a nearby restaurant in Piazza Spagna. I didn't have time for anything else because I arrived around 1 o’clock to Rome."

      "I dedicated this day to go to Vatican City, the place where the Pope of the Catholic Religion resides. It is the world's smallest independent state both by area and population, and is the spiritual and administrative centre of the Roman Catholic Church. Enclosed within Rome, it spans about 44 hectares. The Vatican is renowned for its cultural and religious significance, housing iconic landmarks such as St. Peter's Basilica, the Sistine Chapel, and the Vatican Museums, which collectively hold some of the world's most extraordinary art and historical treasures. The city-state functions as a sovereign entity, with its own postal service, radio station, and banking system. It is the most important place for this religion, the centre of it.",
      "We walked from our hotel to the Vatican, passing by Dell'Orso street which is exactly my surname and took a picture with “my road”. Also, we passed in front of the castle of Sant’Angelo which was built in the Century II a.c. We arrived at the Vatican with the eye-catching view of the St.Peter’s Basilica dome. The entrance to the St.Peter’s Basilica is free but for other activities such as going up to the dome you must pay a fee. The St.Peter’s Basilica is completely amazing with all its colours, architecture and details. You won't see any other church like that in the world. Even if you are not catholic or religious, I think it is a visit you must do if you are in Rome. After a while in the church visiting it all around, I went outside to the place where the tour into the Vatican Museums started. The entrance to the museums is free every last Sunday of the month and you can check the opening hours on their website. The fee for every other day is 20 euros for adults. If you want to make a reservation you will have to pay 5 euros more but you won't have to wait in a queue.",
      "We went through the Vatican museums which have lots of different works of arts and sculptures. Founded by Pope Julius II in the early 16th century, they house an extensive collection of art and historical artefacts accumulated by the Roman Catholic Church over centuries. Highlights include the Sistine Chapel with Michelangelo's renowned ceiling frescoes, the Raphael Rooms adorned with masterpieces by Raphael, and the Gallery of Maps showcasing intricate cartographic works. The museums' diverse collections span classical sculptures, Renaissance art, Egyptian mummies, and Etruscan artefacts, offering a comprehensive overview of artistic and cultural achievements. Unfortunately, you cannot take pictures in the Sistine Chapel because of their policies. This beautiful chapel that explains the Genesis of the bible is the place where a new pope is voted whenever it dies or quits. It is a must if you ever happen to visit Rome. Then I returned after having a meal near the Vatican. ",
      "I passed through Piazza del Popolo with some walls where you can listen to another person on the opposite side of the square. We tried it but couldn't hear too much. Then we walked through Via del Corso and visited some shops to see if we could buy anything we needed. Then after a large day I got to the hotel and rested."

      "Today I woke up very early and went to Roma Termini to take a high-speed train to Napoles so as to go from there to the beautiful island of Capri. We had already booked that train online for around 15 euros each person. From there we took the subway to the Napoli port and waited for our ferry to Capri. We had a reservation for the trip which was around 25 euros per person. I highly recommend making a reservation because otherwise you might not be able to board a ferry and that is even more probable in high season. The waters were pretty rough due to bad climate and it was not a very pleasant experience but you can manage through it. It rained a little bit but then we could enjoy the sun.",
      "Capri, an enchanting island in Italy's Bay of Naples, is renowned for its stunning natural beauty, vibrant flora, and upscale atmosphere. Famous since ancient Roman times, Capri features dramatic cliffs, turquoise waters, and scenic vistas. Key attractions include the Blue Grotto, a mesmerising sea cave illuminated by blue light, and the Gardens of Augustus, offering panoramic views of the island's rugged coastline and the iconic Faraglioni rock formations. The Blue Grotto, although its beauty, I think it is not worth visiting. It is expensive, you enter for just 1 or 2 minutes and you wait a long time to enter, missing the opportunity to do other interesting things. This turns out to be more crucial if you are only 1 day there and with little time.",
      "The island's charming towns, Capri and Anacapri, are known for their narrow streets, high-end shops, and historic sites like the Villa Jovis, the former residence of Emperor Tiberius. Capri's blend of natural splendour, luxurious ambiance, and historical intrigue make it a premier Mediterranean destination. You can visit the Faraglioni rocks by boat but you can take a better view of them from any of the many viewpoints.",
      "I got to the upper part of the island through the monorail train and walked around the centre of the island. There are lots of luxurious shops and restaurants which I did not have the money to enjoy. We walked to the gardens and spent some time taking beautiful pictures of the Faraglioni rocks from a viewpoint. We then went walking around in their passages which seemed like a maze. Be prepared to walk a lot up and down all the time. We then used the bus to go to the other town of the island: Anacapri. It was more rustic and older than Capri but I enjoyed it more. It is where people actually live on the island. We then returned to the port and watched the sea and the rain. Unfortunately, I was not lucky and did not get the nicest day. We then returned to Napoli port and walked around the city to the train station. It is not the safest city but we could enjoy the many argentine charts and flags because Napoli had won the Italian football championship. Their idol is Maradona and as an argentine man watching all those flags and posters is amazing. I then returned home and ate pasta at the “Pastrificcio Guerra” which was a shop that sells pasta and ready made one to eat."

      "I had reached my final day in Rome and of my whole trip in Europe. Today I dedicated it entirely to visiting all the Ancient Rome locations, including the famous Colosseum. I walked all the way through Via del Corso, Rome’s principal street. It finishes in the massive monument to Vittorio Emanuele II who was the one who joined all Italy together and was their first king in 1861. We took a look at it and at the Basilica di Santa Maria in Ara Coeli which has amazing works of art and architecture with incredible details.",
      "We then continued our way to the Roman Colosseum through the Via dei Fori Imperiali. We waited in the line for around 2 hrs which was a lot of time to enter. There are numerous people who try to sneak in the line, don't allow them please. We then entered and we could sense we were in an ancient place but it isn't as great as it sounds. It is better to look at it outside than inside of it. I learned some things through the flyers placed all around. After that, we bought some sandwiches at a supermarket 2 blocks away and made our way in the line to enter the Roman Forum which was a bit less time. In summer it is really hot so have water available with you. ",
      "In the Roman Forum you can see many things. It offers a fascinating glimpse into the ancient city's political, religious, and social life. Visitors can explore numerous significant ruins, including the Senate House (Curia), the Rostra where public speeches were made, and the Temple of Saturn. Other notable structures include the Arch of Titus, commemorating Rome's victory in the Jewish War, and the Temple of Vesta with its iconic circular design. The Basilica of Maxentius and Constantine stands out with its massive arches, and the Via Sacra, the Forum's main thoroughfare, connects many of these historic monuments. The Roman Forum's well-preserved remnants provide a compelling narrative of Rome's illustrious history and grandeur. I highly recommend visiting them if you are interested, as I am, in the history of ancient civilizations. ",
      "We returned and visited again the amazing Fontana di Trevi and went up the stairs of Piazza Spagna and watched the sun go down and this amazing journey go to its end with an incredible meal at a nice restaurant. ",
